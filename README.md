# Simple Calculator Project

This project is a simple calculator implemented in Kotlin. It serves as a personal exercise to gain experience with Kotlin programming and does not aim to influence or replace any production code.

## Disclaimer

This README.md file were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI. The project is a personal endeavor, and while ChatGPT provided guidance, it is not responsible for the development or maintenance of the calculator itself.

## Project Overview

The simple calculator allows basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It supports the use of parentheses and handles unary minus. The implementation follows a postfix expression evaluation approach.

## Getting Started

To use the calculator, you can integrate the provided Kotlin functions into your project or run the included UI code to interact with the calculator visually.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance your understanding of Kotlin programming. Since this project is primarily for learning purposes, you can experiment with different features, optimizations, or user interface improvements.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are not actively sought, as it is a personal exercise. However, if you find any issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue for discussion.
